PROMPT TITLE: Bootstrap pnpm+Nx Monorepo (skeleton only)

GOAL
Initialize a pnpm + Nx monorepo skeleton for Next.js (web), NestJS GraphQL BFF, and empty service folders. NO business logic. NO external integrations. Keep it runnable with strict hygiene and cleanup.

CREATE / MODIFY ONLY
- package.json
- pnpm-workspace.yaml
- nx.json
- tsconfig.base.json
- .gitignore (append, do not overwrite)
- .editorconfig
- .eslintrc.cjs
- .prettierrc
- scripts/cleanup-dev.sh
- apps/web  (Next.js 14, App Router, Tailwind, shadcn/ui installed; i18n scaffold only)
- apps/bff  (NestJS GraphQL Apollo; no resolvers)
- services/identity (NestJS empty)
- services/recognition (NestJS empty)
- services/ledger (NestJS empty)
- packages/types (shared TS types, empty index.ts)
- packages/config (env loader using zod)
- packages/ui (design tokens + shadcn/ui wrapper boilerplate; no pages)
- packages/contracts (empty folders for openapi/, graphql/, events/)
- packages/testing (test utils placeholder)

RULES
- Use pnpm. Configure Nx targets: dev, build, test, lint, e2e for apps/services.
- Ports: web 3000, bff 4000, services 5001–5003.
- .gitignore must include caches/build/temp (do not wipe existing).
- Add scripts:
  - "dev": nx run-many -t dev --parallel
  - "clean": bash scripts/cleanup-dev.sh
- ESLint + TypeScript strict; Jest preconfigured (no tests yet).
- Do NOT add Storybook, Docker, or CI here.
- Print a summary of files created and the exact commands to run.

ACCEPTANCE (run and show outputs)
1) pnpm i
2) pnpm lint  → no errors
3) pnpm dev  → show web starting on :3000 and bff on :4000 (then stop)
4) pnpm clean → temp folders removed
5) git status — should only show the files listed above as new/modified

If anything fails, revert and STOP.
