PROMPT TITLE: Snapshot Legacy UI into /legacy-ui (no business logic)

GOAL
Bring a READ-ONLY copy of the legacy UI from Git into /legacy-ui for reference and reuse. Do NOT touch apps/services. Do NOT overwrite existing files.

INPUTS (I will provide when running this prompt later)
- GIT_URL: https://github.com/samSKIF/ThrivioHR
- INCLUDE PATHS (sparse):
  - client/src/components/**
  - client/src/pages/** (or client/src/app/** if exists)
  - client/src/styles/**
  - client/public/**  (ONLY SVG + images < 300 KB)

CREATE / MODIFY ONLY (during the snapshot run this template describes)
- /legacy-ui/**              (copied files, preserving relative structure)
- /legacy-ui/COMPONENT_MAP.md
- /scripts/snapshot-legacy-ui.ts   (Node script that does shallow sparse clone → copy → report)
- package.json: add script "snapshot:ui": "tsx scripts/snapshot-legacy-ui.ts"

COPY RULES
- Include: .tsx/.jsx/.ts/.js, .css/.scss, *.module.css, .svg, small images (< 300 KB).
- Exclude: node_modules, builds, storybook-static, large assets (≥ 300 KB), any file ≥ 500 lines.
- Do NOT copy environment files or server code.
- Preserve relative paths under /legacy-ui; never overwrite existing files.

OUTPUTS
- Console summary: counts by filetype; top 10 components by import references; total /legacy-ui size (must be < 10 MB).
- /legacy-ui/COMPONENT_MAP.md: list each component with:
  - original path → new path
  - LOC
  - "used by" import graph (component name → count)
  - skipped files (with reason: too large / excluded type)
- No temp folders left behind.

ACCEPTANCE (when running the snapshot later)
1) `pnpm snapshot:ui` completes without errors.
2) /legacy-ui size < 10 MB.
3) Printed summary shows counts + top 10 refs.
4) COMPONENT_MAP.md generated and includes the skipped files list.

IMPORTANT
- This template does not perform the snapshot now. It only creates the instructions and will be used in a later step.
